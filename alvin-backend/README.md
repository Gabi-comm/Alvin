# ALVIN Backend Engine

FastAPI service: infrastructure graph, dynamic routing, emergency management,
sensor ingestion, and a Firebase (Firestore) bridge for Project ALVIN.

## Setup

```bash
cd alvin-backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values
```

Provide the Firebase Admin SDK service-account JSON and point
`FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS` at it. Add an `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` for live weather.

> Without credentials the server still boots (degraded mode): weather works,
> but Firestore-backed endpoints return **503** until configured.

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
